===========

An exercise to practice Javascript and jQuery in a coffee online ordering system.

The app allows users to select drinks and build their order. Once they're ready,
they can submit their order and have a summary displayed on the screen via AJAX.

The app uses Javascript and jQuery to build the order and submit the order.

The app works with the Sinatra server.
